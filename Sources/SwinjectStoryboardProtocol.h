// Objective-C optional protocol method is used instead of protocol extension to workaround the issue that
// default implementation of a protocol method is always called if a class method conforming the protocol
// is defined as an extension in a different framework.

///   Implement this method and setup the default container if you implicitly instantiate UIWindow

/// extension SwinjectStoryboard {
